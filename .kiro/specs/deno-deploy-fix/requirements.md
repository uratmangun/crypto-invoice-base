# Deno Deploy Function Handler Fix - Requirements

## Introduction
This specification addresses the deployment issues encountered when deploying the Crypto Invoice application to Deno Deploy. The main problem was a type mismatch in function handler exports causing connection errors during deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Function Handler Interface
**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function handlers to follow a consistent interface pattern, so that the deployment to Deno Deploy works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a function handler is exported, THEN it SHALL be compatible with Deno Deploy's expected format
2. WHEN a function receives a request, THEN it SHALL properly handle both direct function and object-with-fetch patterns
3. WHEN a function fails, THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages for debugging

### Requirement 2: Reliable Deployment Process
**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a reliable deployment process to Deno Deploy, so that updates can be deployed with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the GitHub Action runs, THEN it SHALL properly include all necessary files in the deployment
2. WHEN the deployment fails, THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN the deployment succeeds, THEN the application SHALL be accessible at the expected URL

### Requirement 3: Type Safety
**User Story:** As a TypeScript developer, I want proper type definitions for function handlers, so that type-related errors are caught at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a function handler is defined, THEN its type SHALL be explicitly declared
2. WHEN a function handler is used, THEN TypeScript SHALL verify its signature
3. WHEN a type mismatch occurs, THEN it SHALL be caught during development, not deployment
