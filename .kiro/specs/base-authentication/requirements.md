# Base Authentication Requirements

## Introduction
Implementation of Web3 authentication system for the Crypto Invoice Generator using Base network wallet signatures, replacing traditional email/password authentication with a secure, decentralized "Sign in with Base" flow following SIWE (Sign in with Ethereum) standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Base Authentication Button
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a "Sign in with Base" button that follows Base's brand guidelines, so that I can authenticate using my Base wallet without confusion about the authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Base" button with the official Base blue square icon
2. WHEN the user hovers over the button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate hover states
3. WHEN the button is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow Base's brand guidelines for color, typography, and iconography
4. WHEN the page is in dark mode THEN the system SHALL adapt the button styling appropriately for dark backgrounds

### Requirement 2: Wallet Connection and Signature
**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my wallet signature, so that I can securely access the application without creating or remembering passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks "Sign in with Base" THEN the system SHALL prompt for wallet connection using standard Web3 methods
2. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL generate a unique nonce for the authentication session
3. WHEN the nonce is generated THEN the system SHALL create a SIWE-compliant message with domain, URI, statement, chain ID, and nonce
4. WHEN the message is created THEN the system SHALL request the user to sign the message using their connected wallet
5. WHEN the user rejects the signature request THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3: Backend Signature Verification
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all wallet signatures to be cryptographically verified on the backend, so that only legitimate users with valid wallet ownership can access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a signature is received from the frontend THEN the system SHALL verify the signature against the original message using Viem library
2. WHEN verifying signatures THEN the system SHALL ensure the signature corresponds to the claimed wallet address
3. WHEN a nonce is used for verification THEN the system SHALL mark it as consumed to prevent replay attacks
4. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response with 401 status
5. WHEN signature verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a session token and return success response

### Requirement 4: API Configuration and Fallback
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to work reliably across development and production environments, so that users can authenticate regardless of network conditions or deployment status.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL configure API endpoints for local development and production deployment
2. WHEN making authentication requests THEN the system SHALL attempt multiple endpoint fallbacks in order of preference
3. WHEN a primary endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL automatically try the next available endpoint without user intervention
4. WHEN all endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
5. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL use the specified Deno Deploy URL for production

### Requirement 5: User Experience and Navigation
**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth authentication flow that redirects me to the appropriate page after successful login, so that I can immediately start using the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the invoice creation page
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading states and disable the authentication button
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and allow the user to retry
4. WHEN the user lacks a Web3 wallet THEN the system SHALL display helpful guidance about installing a compatible wallet
5. WHEN the user cancels the authentication process THEN the system SHALL return to the initial login state
