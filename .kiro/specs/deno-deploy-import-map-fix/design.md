# Deno Deploy Import Map Error Fix Design

## Architecture Overview
The solution addresses deployment issues across two platforms (Deno Deploy and Cloudflare Pages) by configuring proper import map resolution and TypeScript compilation settings. The architecture maintains a single deno.json configuration file that serves dual purposes as both import map and TypeScript configuration.

## Technical Approach
The fix involves three key technical strategies:
1. **Explicit Import Map Configuration**: Ensure deno.json properly serves as the import map for Deno Deploy
2. **TypeScript Configuration Adjustment**: Modify TypeScript settings to allow unused variables for Cloudflare Pages compatibility
3. **Deployment Workflow Optimization**: Update GitHub Actions workflows to properly reference import maps and handle platform-specific requirements

## Component Design

### Deno Configuration (deno.json)
- **Purpose**: Serves as both import map and TypeScript configuration
- **Dependencies**: None (root configuration file)
- **Interface**: Provides imports mapping and TypeScript compiler options for both deployment platforms

### GitHub Actions Workflow (deploy.yml)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates deployment to Deno Deploy using deployctl
- **Dependencies**: deno.json, DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN, main.ts entry point
- **Interface**: Reads deno.json for import map, executes deployctl with proper configuration

### Cloudflare Pages Configuration
- **Purpose**: Handles TypeScript compilation for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- **Dependencies**: deno.json TypeScript configuration
- **Interface**: Uses modified TypeScript settings to ignore unused variable errors

### Application Entry Point (main.ts)
- **Purpose**: Serves as the consistent entry point across deployment platforms
- **Dependencies**: Import map from deno.json
- **Interface**: Imports modules using mapped paths, compatible with both platforms

## Data Flow
1. **Deployment Initiation**: GitHub Actions triggers deployment workflow
2. **Configuration Reading**: deployctl reads deno.json for import map configuration
3. **Import Resolution**: Deno runtime resolves imports using the configured import map
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Platform-specific TypeScript compilation with adjusted settings
5. **Deployment Execution**: Application deploys successfully to target platform
6. **Verification**: Deployment status confirmed and tested

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Import map resolution occurs at runtime, minimal performance impact
- TypeScript compilation settings optimized for deployment speed over strict checking

### Security
- DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN properly secured in GitHub Actions secrets
- Import map restricts module resolution to explicitly defined paths

### Scalability
- Configuration approach scales to additional deployment platforms
- Single deno.json maintains consistency across environments

### Compatibility
- Solution maintains backward compatibility with existing Deno applications
- TypeScript settings balance strict checking with deployment requirements

### Error Handling
- Import map errors now properly resolved through explicit configuration
- TypeScript unused variable errors gracefully ignored for deployment
- Deployment failures provide clear error messages for debugging
