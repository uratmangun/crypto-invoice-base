# Deno Deploy Import Map Error Fix Requirements

## Introduction
This specification addresses deployment issues encountered when deploying a Deno application to both Deno Deploy and Cloudflare Pages. The primary issues involve import map resolution errors and TypeScript compilation errors that prevent successful deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Deno Deploy Import Map Resolution
**User Story:** As a developer, I want my Deno application to deploy successfully to Deno Deploy without import map errors, so that my application can be accessible in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL locate and use the import map from deno.json
2. WHEN deployctl executes THEN the system SHALL resolve all imports without "Import map not found" errors
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful deployment status

### Requirement 2: Cloudflare Pages TypeScript Compilation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want my Deno application to build successfully on Cloudflare Pages despite unused variables, so that I can deploy to multiple platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the system SHALL ignore unused variable errors (TS6133)
2. WHEN the build process executes THEN the system SHALL complete without failing on noUnusedLocals or noUnusedParameters
3. WHEN the deployment finishes THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy to Cloudflare Pages

### Requirement 3: Deployment Configuration Consistency
**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent deployment configurations across platforms, so that I can maintain the same codebase for multiple deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deno.json is configured THEN the system SHALL serve as both import map and TypeScript config
2. WHEN deployment workflows run THEN the system SHALL use the same entry point (main.ts) across platforms
3. WHEN configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with both Deno Deploy and Cloudflare Pages

### Requirement 4: Deployment Verification
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that deployment fixes work correctly, so that I can ensure production stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deployment tests run THEN the system SHALL complete without import map errors
2. WHEN build verification executes THEN the system SHALL ignore TypeScript unused variable warnings
3. WHEN deployment status is checked THEN the system SHALL confirm successful deployment to both platforms
