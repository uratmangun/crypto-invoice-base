# Privy Authentication Integration Design

## Architecture Overview
The Privy authentication integration follows a client-server architecture where the React frontend handles user authentication through Privy's SDK, while a Deno backend manages invoice data persistence to Redis. The system maintains separation of concerns with authentication handled client-side and data operations server-side.

## Technical Approach
- **Frontend**: React application with Privy SDK integration for authentication
- **Backend**: Deno functions for server-side operations and Redis data persistence
- **Authentication Flow**: Privy handles both wallet and email authentication methods
- **State Management**: React state for UI, Privy session management for authentication
- **Data Storage**: Redis for invoice persistence with environment-based configuration

## Component Design

### Privy Authentication Provider
- **Purpose**: Wraps the application to provide authentication context
- **Dependencies**: Privy SDK, React Context API
- **Interface**: Provides authentication state, login/logout methods, user data

### Enhanced Sign-In Component
- **Purpose**: Replaces basic "Sign in with Base" button with Privy authentication
- **Dependencies**: Privy authentication provider
- **Interface**: Triggers authentication modal, handles success/error states

### Logout Component
- **Purpose**: Provides logout functionality on protected pages
- **Dependencies**: Privy authentication provider
- **Interface**: Logout button that terminates session and redirects

### Invoice Creation Form (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Streamlined form leveraging authenticated user data
- **Dependencies**: Privy user context for wallet address auto-fill
- **Interface**: Form inputs with optional due date, wallet auto-fill button

### Invoice Viewing Component
- **Purpose**: Displays created invoices with mock data
- **Dependencies**: React Router for navigation
- **Interface**: Invoice display with formatted data presentation

### Redis Persistence Function
- **Purpose**: Deno function to save invoice data to Redis
- **Dependencies**: Redis client, environment configuration
- **Interface**: HTTP endpoint accepting invoice data, returns success/error response

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User clicks sign-in → Privy modal opens → User selects method (wallet/email)
   - Authentication completes → User data stored in context → UI updates with authenticated state

2. **Invoice Creation Flow**:
   - User navigates to /create-invoice → Form loads with authenticated user context
   - User fills form → Optional wallet auto-fill from Privy → Form submission
   - Data sent to Deno function → Saved to Redis → Confirmation returned

3. **Session Management Flow**:
   - User clicks logout → Privy session terminated → Context cleared → Redirect to home

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy load Privy SDK to reduce initial bundle size
- Implement proper React memoization for authentication state
- Use Redis connection pooling for efficient data operations

### Security
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration (Privy App ID, Redis URL)
- Secure session management through Privy's built-in security
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- HTTPS enforcement for production deployment

### Scalability
- Stateless Deno functions for horizontal scaling
- Redis for fast data access and session storage
- Component-based architecture for maintainable code growth

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when authentication fails
- Redis connection error handling with user feedback
- Network error handling for all API calls
- Fallback UI states for loading and error conditions

### Environment Configuration
- `.env.example` with all required variables documented
- Cloudflare Pages deployment configuration for environment injection
- Development vs production environment handling
- Clear error messages for missing configuration

### Integration Points
- Privy SDK integration following official documentation guidelines
- React Router integration for protected routes
- Deno runtime integration for serverless functions
- Redis client integration with connection management
