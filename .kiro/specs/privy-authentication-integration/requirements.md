# Privy Authentication Integration Requirements

## Introduction
Integration of Privy authentication system into the crypto invoice generator to provide secure user authentication with wallet connectivity and email sign-in capabilities. This replaces the basic "Sign in with Base" button with a comprehensive authentication solution that supports both wallet and email authentication methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Privy Authentication Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using Privy's authentication system, so that I can securely access the invoice creation features with my wallet or email.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user clicks the sign-in button THEN the system SHALL initiate Privy authentication flow
2. WHEN Privy authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store user session and wallet information
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display user information in the UI

### Requirement 2: Multi-Method Authentication Support
**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using either my wallet or email address, so that I have flexible authentication options.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the authentication modal opens THEN the system SHALL provide both wallet and email sign-in options
2. WHEN a user selects email authentication THEN the system SHALL allow email-based sign-in through Privy
3. WHEN a user selects wallet authentication THEN the system SHALL connect to their Web3 wallet
4. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user experience regardless of method

### Requirement 3: Session Management and Logout
**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to be able to log out from any page, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user is on the /create-invoice page THEN the system SHALL display a logout button
2. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL terminate the Privy session
3. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the home page
4. WHEN the user is logged out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication state

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Invoice Creation Form
**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want a streamlined invoice creation form that leverages my authentication data, so that I can create invoices more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the invoice form loads THEN the system SHALL NOT display Client Address and Client Email fields
2. WHEN creating an invoice THEN the system SHALL allow optional due date selection
3. WHEN a user wants to use their wallet address THEN the system SHALL provide a button to auto-fill from Privy account
4. WHEN the auto-fill button is clicked THEN the system SHALL populate the wallet address field with the authenticated user's address

### Requirement 5: Invoice Viewing Capability
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view created invoices, so that I can track and manage my invoicing activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL provide a way to view the invoice
2. WHEN viewing an invoice THEN the system SHALL display all invoice details in a readable format
3. WHEN the invoice view loads THEN the system SHALL show mock data for demonstration purposes
4. WHEN viewing invoices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence with Redis
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want invoice data to be persisted in Redis, so that invoices can be stored and retrieved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL save the invoice data to Redis using a Deno function
2. WHEN saving to Redis THEN the system SHALL use the REDIS_URL environment variable for connection
3. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN invoice data is saved THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation to the user

### Requirement 7: Environment Configuration and Deployment
**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration for Privy integration, so that the application can be deployed with the necessary credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include Privy environment variables in .env.example
2. WHEN deploying to Cloudflare Pages THEN the system SHALL inject required environment variables
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN REDIS_URL is configured THEN the system SHALL be able to connect to the Redis instance
